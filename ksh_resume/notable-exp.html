            <h2>Throughout my life thus far, I have achieved 
                a few different things worth noting outside of 
                normal work experience: </h2>
            <p> Throughout my time in 
                middle school and high school I joined the Boy 
                Scouts of America and managed to obtain the rank of 
                Eagle Scout at the age of 17. In high school, I took 
                the initiative of enrolling in Advanced Placement 
                courses and even some summer courses at Austin Community 
                College to open up my schedule for other classes in my 
                junior and senior years. Among all my achievements 
                outside of work, however, my biggest was probably 
                successfully serving two years as a missionary for 
                the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 
                Porto Alegre, Brazil and various parts of West Virginia 
                during the COVID-19 pandemic. During my time in service, 
                I learned how to hold a conversation in Portuguese and 
                how to successfully teach. I spent a lot of time at 
                various food pantries serving the community in 
                West Virginia.</p>
