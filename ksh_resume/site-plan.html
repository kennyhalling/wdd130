      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Kenneth Scott Halling, a current student of Brigham Young University - Idaho, online. I am 22 years old, born on November 14th, 2000. I am working on my bachelors degree in Applied Technology, 
        hoping to focus on becoming a software engineer and backend/frontend developer. 
        As of now, I have trained in using Python and HTML/CSS as programming languages. I value being an honest and kind person above all else,
        and do my best to serve those around me whenever I get the chance. I work hard in school and at work to get the jobs assigned to me done right. In my free time,
        I like to unwind with some simple video games, or by playing Dungeons & Dragons, or other board games, with my friends and family. I currently live in Austin, Texas, 
        and have been here since I was 7 years old (I was originally born in Houston, Texas), 
        though I am looking to spread my wings a bit and move out to somewhere else for a change. I am skilled in writing, learning, leadership, communication,
        and organization, and I have a good eye for detail and finding 
        ways to improve my environment to make it more aesthetic and productive.

      <h3>Notable Experience</h3>
      <p>
        Throughout my life thus far, I have achieved a few different things worth noting outside of normal work experience. 
        Throughout my time in middle school and high school I joined the Boy Scouts of America and managed to obtain the rank of Eagle Scout at the age of 17. 
        In high school, I took the initiative of enrolling in Advanced Placement courses and even some summer courses at Austin Community College to open up my 
        schedule for other classes in my junior and senior years. Among all my achievements outside of work, however, my biggest was probably successfully serving 
        two years as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Porto Alegre, Brazil and various parts of West Virginia during the COVID-19 pandemic.
        During my time in service, I learned how to hold a conversation in Portuguese and how to successfully teach. I spent a lot of time at various food pantries,
        serving the community in West Virginia.

      <h3>Work Experience</h3>
      <p>
        My work experience is a bit varied. When I was a teenager, I made my money by mowing lawns for people on the street. 
        I had a few regular customers and had my brothers take over for me once I got old enough to get hired in other places. 
        My first official job was as a valet garbage collector, where I took garbage from peoples’ doorsteps to their dumpster in an apartment complex. 
        The name of this company was Value Waste Services, and I held this job for over a year during high school, 
        and right up until I left for my mission in late 2019.. My second official job I held for just a month before my mission to earn a little extra money: 
        working as a professional Christmas decorator for a flower shop called the Flower Studio. They offered a seasonal Christmas 
        decorating service for high-end hotels and other locations, and I became a frequent person they called on for jobs requiring a 
        lot of attention to detail. Finally, my current job that I’ve had for about a year now is at SISU Devices, an engineering firm that 
        designs knife-sharpening machines. I work as a manufacturing technician, putting these machines together.
