            <p>My name is Kenneth Scott Halling, a current student
                of Brigham Young University - Idaho, online. I am 22 
                years old, born on November 14th, 2000. I am working 
                on my bachelors degree in Applied Technology, hoping 
                to focus on becoming a software engineer and 
                backend/frontend developer. As of now, I have trained 
                in using Python and HTML/CSS as programming languages.
                I currently live in Austin, Texas, and have been here 
                since I was 7 years old (I was originally born in Houston,
                Texas), though I am looking to spread my wings a bit and 
                move out to somewhere else for a change.</p>

            <p> I value being an honest and kind person above all else, 
                and do my best to serve those around me whenever I get 
                the chance. I work hard in school and at work to get the 
                jobs assigned to me done right. In my free time, I like 
                to unwind with some simple video games, or by playing 
                Dungeons & Dragons, or other board games, with my friends 
                and family. I am skilled in writing, learning, leadership, 
                communication, and organization, and I have a good eye for 
                detail and finding ways to improve my environment to make 
                it more aesthetic and productive.</p>
