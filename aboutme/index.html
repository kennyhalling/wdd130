    <h2>Kenneth Scott Halling</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Kenneth Halling. I'm 22 years old and 
    pursuing a degree in Applied Technology. I also work as a manufacturing
    technician in order to pay for all this. </p><p>I've been a member of the Church
    of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints since birth, and just finished 
    serving my mission about a year ago. I was serving in both Porto Alegre,
    Brazil and Charelston, West Virginia due to COVID-19.</p><p>I'm excited
    to be in this class, thanks for reading my first webpage!</p>
