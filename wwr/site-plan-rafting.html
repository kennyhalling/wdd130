    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>We want to create a site that caters to all types of rafters; whether they
        are just beginning or experienced, we want them to be able to quickly find
        what resources they need with a quick look at our site. In doing this, we hope
        to retain our loyal customers and attract new ones wishing to explore white water
        rafting.
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our audience will primarily consist of the 18 to 30 demographic, both experienced
        and not, who are interested in outdoor sports. We want to quickly show them how
        much our services cost based on what they expect, and to provide them with easy to
        access information surrounding what service they choose. We hope to surpass our
        competitors by providing our audience with quick-access information and a wide variety
        of services that apply to those looking to budget or those looking to splurge. In 
        a world where phones are a growing necessity at everyone's side, we want to focus on
        making our site accesible primarily to mobile devices.

Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
