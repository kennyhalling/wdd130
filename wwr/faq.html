                    <h1 class="question">Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</h1>
                    <h2 class="answer">Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. 
                        We have found however that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more 
                        overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8). 
                        A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck
                        on a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children
                        of any age. The areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the world,
                        and you never know what you might see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids which
                        keep things very interesting. Each boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has been
                        proven that river guides are unable to go for very long at all without telling stories...
                        some of which are even true!</h2>
